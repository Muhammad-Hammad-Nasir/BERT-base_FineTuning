# BERT-base_FineTuning

I have a pretrained BERT model. My use-case is to assess market sentiment and gauge investor confidence by analyzing the sentiment of financial news articles, earnings reports, and other financial communications. However, base BERT does not have knowledge about financial terms.

**How will I proceed with my use-case using a language model?**

I will have to fine-tune the BERT model on past market insights data.
